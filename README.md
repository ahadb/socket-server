# README

Basic socket server in Node using socket.io

## Usage

* npm install in `/` and `client/socket-client` (you can cd up one and paste)
* nodemon socket-server.js
* cd client/socket-client && npm start

You will receive an object whose keys (...from an interval response) you are mapping over on the UI.

## TODO

Will add a grid later to see the actual power and simplicity!
